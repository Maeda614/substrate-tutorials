# Exercises to learn substrate

## How to train ?

- fork this repository  
- clone it on your machine  
- code until all tests passes

> By default running `cargo test` will run test for every exercises in the workspace. Which is not optimal while working on a specific exercise.
> You can either change directory and run `cargo test` from a specific pallet folder or edit the root `Cargo.toml`, changing `members` to only include your current exercise 

If you want to run your pallet in a real runtime, you can easely edit the `substrate-node-template` and add your pallet to it's runtime.

## What is in those exercises ?

We designed the exercises to teach you:
- how to use the numerous features of Substrate
- some good Substrate practices
- some blockchain core principles

If you are stuck, you can always check the solution branch. It's not cheating, it's just learning üßë‚Äçüéì
